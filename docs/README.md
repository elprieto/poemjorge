## Biography  
Jorge Manrique was born in a time around 1432, when his parents, Rodrigo Manrique and doña Mencía de Figueroa, married, and 1444, when Rodrigo Manrique being widower tried to marry again and had to ask for apostolic dispense thanks to his knight condition in _la Orden de Santiago_.
Usually said to be born during the second half of 1439 and the first of 1440, year in which his father, Rodrigo Manrique, bought a _señorío_ (manor) from Paredes de Nava. 
  
Jorge was a rather uncommon name, and it could possibly be given to him due to his father closeness with the Aragón Infants, which are King Fernando I of Aragón and Leonor of Albuquerque's children, being the reason that their kingdom's saint patron was St Jorge.

Jorge Manrique's father was an influential man and had great power during his time, he died age sixty to cancer. Jorge's mother died when Jorge was still a child. His family was one of the most ancient noble families of Spain and possesed some of the most important titles of Castille, such as the Nájera Duchy, the Treviño County and the Aguilar De Campoo Marquisate.

Rodrigo Manrique had a great influence in Jorge's life and tried to, through art and education, make Jorge as similar to him as possible. Jorge had military and art studies. He fought the Muslims, took a part in the raising against Enrique IV of Castille, fougt in Ajofrín in favour of Isabel, against Juana _la Beltraneja_ during the Castillian succession war.

Jorge married doña Guiomar de Castañeda, per purely economic interest, and had two children Luis and Luisa.

Jorge Manrique was a Spanish poet, famous for _Couplets to his Father's Death_, it was the maximum example of cortisan liric from the XV century and one of the most important Spanish elegies. In his poetry he liked to write about a normal life, out of the nobility and the castles

Jorge Manrique was both a poet and a soldier, he fought along his father on Isabella I of Castile's side. He died after being fatally wounded  during an assault to the Garcimuñoz Castle and died during the spring of 1479.  

Jorge was not a very prolific poet, he wrote aproximately 50 compositions, which are usually divided into three groups: love poems, doctrinal poems and burlesque poems, having the love poems the major number of all of them, with some being erotic. This poems fall into the Cortisan Love current of that time.   
Written after his father's death (1476), _Couplets to his Father's Death_ was published in 1494, under the title _Coplas de Jorge Manrique a la muerte de su padre, el Maestre don Rodrigo_ (_Couplets of Jorge Manrique to his father's death, Master don Rodrigo_).  
  
It was one of the first examples in poetry that besides talking about terrenal life and eternal life, also mentioned fame and how it could give another dimension to the afterlife. Mentioning how life was being remembered by other people after death.  
   
The couplets were published posthumously in between 1480 and 1490. They were so famous that were translated to Latin and served as inspiration for many poets after that. Written in Pie Quebrado (Broken-foot) style, a 12-line stanza having 4 triplets of 8-,8-, and 4-syllable lines and with a rhyme scheme of abcabcdefdef. The structure of the couplets is divided in three major parts, the first one serves as introduction and motivation surrounding how life is almost worthless, the middle part talks about important late figures of the time and their death, and the last deals with Rodrigo Manrique and it is dedicated to glorify his figure, comparing him with great characters of the Roman Empire to stress his virtues and ending with a dialog between him and the Death.

The main theme is death and it deals with death from the abstract to the human.

## Textual History

Previous to _Coplas por la Muerte de su Padre_, the Dance of the Death were the mainstream. Due to the lack of happiness of the populace, satirical and critic poems emerged, poems that criticized the vices of the court, which were abundant. Poems that were alegoric to how death approaches everyone independently on the position, either king or slave death will catch everyone. Mentioning also vices, crimes and sins that all the spheres of society had or commited.

The cortisan lyric or poesy envolved the platonic sensual poems, however, many of them were real, and these were sung by minstrels and troubadours. These poems raised paralelly with Dante's style of filosofic and moral poems where clever and witty artists participated in tournaments around the courts of Spain and Europe. Examples of this stream of poesy were Iñigo López de Mendoza, known as El Marqués de Santillana, Juan de Mena, and even Jorge Manrique.

The Chivalry books were very famous around these years, with  _Amadís de Gaula_ as the major exponent to this stream, these poems were made to have a gerat effect on the common audience and having them imagining how the chivalry life was.

Theatre was also a big component of the 15th Century literary background, having _La Celestina_ as the major example of Humanistic Comedy.

Lastly, the satiric prose had a big impact on this society, and although sometimes women were the main critic it was used to expose the problem to lust and human vices and sins.

All these streams influenced Jorge Manrique during his life and he even referenced them on his poem.

## Social and Historical context

---

The poem was written in the 15th Century, when the kingdoms of Castilla and Aragón faced constant chrysis, endemic famine and uncessant wars. England clashed with France in the Hundred Years' War. The Church was facing difficult times whith the end of the Borgias Dinasty and an emerging Lutheranian Church that was gaining power.

What nowadays is known as Spain was divided in two main kingdoms, Castilla and Aragón. Castilla mantained a farming lifestyle with an increasing power of the nobility that owned the land and lack of power for the farmers that worked them, the clash between kingdoms was portrayed in one of the greatest Spanish poems _El Cantar del Mío Cid_, which has been adapted by Amazon. Aragón lacked succesion and crowned king Fernando de Antequera, which leaded to the marriage between Fernando and Isabel, queen of Castilla, forming what we actually know as Spain.
Spain was surrounded by political and racial tension, as the Christian church was losing power, the Moorish and Jews had a feeling of dejection due to the Christian favour of the medieval ages and the only thing the Spanish inhabitants could do was to keep hoping for a better future.

The literature of the time was centered around love and sensuality, based on symbols and alegories, dedicated to a majorly illiterate society that approached language orally, through the minstrel school, what is known to be the oral tradition of poems and novels orally transmited through minstrels and theatre, for it was really cheap, around 5 cents adjusted to inflation. The other way of spreading literature was the monasteries with clerks translating and writing poems, however this process was very slow as it had to be done writing by hand and in many cases the poems were censored and transmited with biased and poor information.

  
## Editorial Rationale
---  
  
The first editorial decision I took was the selection of the texts to include. The selection consists on four different texts.
The first one belongs to _La Real Academia de la Lengua Española_, the Spanish official institute designated to study how language develops and then update the Spanish dictionary, modernizing language and grammar if necessary. Therefore, this text has academic support and its based on the original one.
The second one belongs to _La Universidad de Valencia_, Valencia's univeristy, having support of academic institutions and researchers that have adapted the text to nowadays Spanish vocabulary and grammar.
The third one belongs to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, one of the most influential poets in the 19th Century America, famous for the translation of Dante's _Divine Comedy_ and Jorge Manrique's _Couplets to his Father's Death_, he belonged to the Fireside Poets, he lived in Spain's capital city, Madrid, with Washington Irving, where thanks to him he learned about Spanish literary culture and famous novelists and poets such as Cervantes, Lope de Vega or Pedro Calderón de la Barca, when his sister died he found relief reading Jorge Manrique's elegy, being that a possible reasong for his translation of the poem.
The fourth poem is my own translation of the poem, made to be more similar in meaning than in rhyme, for I think that a good piece of literature must have a good meaning even if it lacks form. However, the structure of the poem is still there and I have tried to make it rhyme following the same pattern as the original one but using the language included in the updated version, because in my opinion the language used in the original version is to deviated from its original meaning, as a consequence language adaptation is required.

The word choice selected in the translation has been made thinking in the meaning of the poem, trying to have them rhyming but giving preference to the meaning when both could not happen at the same time, this words may be too simple due to my lack of Enghlish vocabulary and the date in which the poem was written, for it contains a great sum of complex and outdated vocabulary that make sense when read but that makes the translation of the poem very difficult due to the fact that these words and expressions may not be used in Spanish anymore

My focus on the translation was to keep the original meaning of the poem while not mantaining so much the form for the reason that I think that the meaning is more important than the rhyme on this poem due to the fact that this poem is an elegy, therefore the meaning is, in my opinion, more required to keep the original meaning of allusion to death's honor, his father's fame and importance, is the original target of this poem, consequently the rhyme pattern, although important and one of the most important examples of Spanish Couplets, the main core of the poem is the meaning of it.

\[I\]

Recuerde el alma dormida,  
avive el seso y despierte  
contemplando  
cómo se pasa la vida,  
cómo se viene la muerte  
tan callando;  
cuán presto se va el placer;  
cómo después de acordado  
da dolor;  
cómo a nuestro parecer  
cualquiera tiempo pasado  
fue mejor.  

\[II\]

Pues si vemos lo presente
cómo en un punto se es ido
y acabado,
si juzgamos sabiamente,
daremos lo no venido
por pasado.
No se engañe nadie, no,
pensando que ha de durar
lo que espera
más que duró lo que vio,
pues que todo ha de pasar
por tal manera

### Henry Wadsworth Longfellow 

O let the soul her slumbers break,
Let thought be quickened, and awake  
Awake to see 
How soon this life is past and gone,  
And death comes softly stealing on,  
How silently!  
Swiftly our pleasures glide away,
Our hearts recall the distant day
With many sighs;
The moments that are speeding fast
We heed not, but the past,—the past,
More highly prize.

Onward its course the present keeps,
Onward the constant current sweeps,
Till life is done;
And, did we judge of time aright,
The past and future in their flight
Would be as one.

Let no one fondly dream again,
That Hope and all her shadowy train
Will not decay;
Fleeting as were the dreams of old,
Remembered like a tale that's told,
They pass away.

### Own version

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:chocolate">Aware</span> the sleeping soul,  

<span style="color:chocolate">brighten the sense</span>
 and wake up;  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contemplating  

how life passes,  

how death approaches  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so <span style="color:chocolate">unspeaking;</span>  
<br>

<span style="color:chocolate">when, quickly leaves the enjoyment</span>
  

<span style="color:chocolate">how, after remembered,</span>  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it causes pain,  

<span style="color:chocolate">how to our judgement</span>  

any past time  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was better.  

Then, if we see the present
as a point that is already gone
and done,
if we judge wisely
we will give what what has not come
as done.
Do not fool yourself, no,
thinking that the things must last
what you think
The things thy saw are gone,
for everything must end
in that same way.
