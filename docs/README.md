## Biography  

Jorge Manrique was born in a time around 1432, when his parents, Rodrigo Manrique and doña Mencía de Figueroa, married, and 1444, when Rodrigo Manrique, being a widower, tried to marry again and had to ask for apostolic dispense thanks to his knight condition in la Orden de Santiago. Manrique is usually said to be born during the second half of 1439 or the first of 1440, the year in which his father, Rodrigo Manrique, bought a señorío (manor) from Paredes de Nava.  
<br>
Jorge Manrique’s father was an influential man and had great power during his time, he died at age sixty from cancer. Jorge’s mother died when Jorge was still a child. His family was one of the most ancient noble families of Spain and possessed some of the most important titles of Castille, such as the Nájera Duchy, the Treviño County and the Aguilar De Campoo Marquisate. We can see how his father named him Jorge possibly due to his father closeness with the Aragón Infants, which are King Fernando I of Aragón and Leonor of Albuquerque’s children, being the reason that their kingdom’s saint patron was St Jorge, as Jorge was a rather uncommon name during that time.  
<br>
Rodrigo Manrique had a great influence in Jorge’s life and tried to, through art and education, make Jorge as like him as possible. Jorge studied military and art.Jorge Manrique was both a poet and a soldier, he fought alongside his father on Isabella I of Castile’s side.  He fought the Muslims, took a part in the rising against Enrique IV of Castille, fought in Ajofrín in favor of Isabel, and against Juana la Beltraneja during the Castilian succession war. Jorge died after being fatally wounded during an assault on Garcimuñoz Castle and died during the spring of 1479.  
<br>
Jorge married doña Guiomar de Castañeda, for economic interest,however their marriage was a good one and they made life together (During those times marrying someone and not seeing them again or being unhappy was very common) had two children Luis and Luisa.  
<br>
Jorge was not a very prolific poet, he wrote approximately fifty compositions, which are usually divided into three groups: love poems, doctrinal poems, and burlesque poems, in his poetry, he liked to write about a normal life, out of the nobility and the castles. The majority of his poems are love poems, some of which were erotic. These poems represent Courtesan Love, which was a current ideology of that time. However we can say that his career was based rather on quality than on quantity, Jorge, famous for Couplets to his Father’s Death, created the maximum example of courtesan lyric from the XV century and one of the most important Spanish elegies. 
<br>
Written after his father’s death (1476), Couplets to his Father’s Death was published posthumously in 1494, under the title Coplas de Jorge Manrique a la muerte de su padre, el Maestre don Rodrigo (Couplets of Jorge Manrique to his father’s death, Master don Rodrigo). It was one of the first examples in poetry that, besides talking about earthly life and eternal life, also mentioned fame and how it could give another dimension to the afterlife, because life also includes being remembered by other people after death. The couplets were published posthumously between 1480 and 1490. They were so famous that they were translated to Latin and served as inspiration for many poets after that. Written in Pie Quebrado (Broken-foot) style, a 12-line stanza having 4 triplets of 8-,8-, and 4-syllable lines and with a rhyme scheme of abcabcdefdef. The structure of the couplets is divided in three major parts, the first one serves as introduction and motivation surrounding how life is almost worthless, the middle part talks about important late figures of the time and their death, and the last deals with Rodrigo Manrique and it is dedicated to glorifying his figure, comparing him with great characters of the Roman Empire to stress his virtues and ending with a dialog between him and the Death.  
<br>
The main theme is death and it deals with death from the abstract to the human, bringing at first very complex topics and terms that were imaginative and then moving from those to more human, flesh-like, topics that people could understand better.  

## Textual History

---

Previous to Coplas por la Muerte de su Padre, the Dance of the Death poems were the main literary movement . Due to the lack of happiness of the populace, satirical and critical poems emerged, poems that criticized the vices of the court, which were abundant. Poems that were allegoric of how death approaches everyone independently, and,whether king or slave, death will catch everyone. These poems also mention vices, crimes and sins that all the spheres of society had or committed.  <br>
The courtesan lyric or poesy is surrounded by platonic sensual poems; however, many of them were real, and these were sung by minstrels and troubadours. These poems were written in parallel with Dante’s style of philosophical and moral poems where clever and witty artists participated in tournaments around the courts of Spain and Europe. Examples of this stream of poetry were Iñigo López de Mendoza, known as El Marqués de Santillana, Juan de Mena, and even Jorge Manrique.
<br>
The chivalry books were very famous around these years, with  Amadís de Gaula as the major exponent to this stream, these poems were made to have a great effect on the common audience and have them imagining how the chivalry life was.  
Theater was also a big component of the 15th Century literary scene, with La Celestina as the major example of Humanistic Comedy.  
Lastly, satiric prose had a big impact on this society, and although sometimes women were the main critic, it was used to expose the problem to lust and human vices and sins.  
<br>
All these streams influenced Jorge Manrique during his life and he even referenced them in his poem. We can see it on the poem and the content, being an elegy this poem represent mourning for someone that has been lost, in this case, Jorge Manrique's father, this is important because he was one of the mayor influences Jorge had during his life and this poem serves him to process all the love that he had and transform it from his thinking into words and, more importantly, a tool to remember his father.  

## Social and Historical context

---

The poem was written in the 15th Century, when the kingdoms of Castilla and Aragón faced constant crisis, endemic famine, and incessant wars. England clashed with France in the Hundred Years’ War. The Church was facing difficult times with the end of the Borgias Dynasty and an emerging Lutheran Church that was gaining power.  
What nowadays is known as Spain was divided in two main kingdoms, Castilla and Aragón. Castilla maintained a farming lifestyle with an increasing power of the nobility that owned the land and lack of power for the farmers that worked them, the clash between kingdoms was portrayed in one of the greatest Spanish poems El Cantar del Mío Cid, which has been adapted by Amazon. Aragón lacked succession and crowned king Fernando de Antequera, which led to the marriage between Fernando and Isabel, queen of Castilla, forming what we actually know as Spain. Spain was surrounded by political and racial tension, as the Christian church was losing power, the Moorish and Jews had a feeling of dejection due to the Christian favor of the medieval ages and the only thing the Spanish inhabitants could do was to keep hoping for a better future.
<br>
The literature of the time was centered around love and sensuality, based on symbols and allegories, dedicated to a majorly illiterate society that approached language orally, through the minstrel school, what is known to be the oral tradition of poems and novels orally transmitted through minstrels and theater.  
<br>
Theatrical representations were very common in Spain during that time, the reason being that it was really cheap, around 5 cents adjusted to inflation. The other way of spreading literature was the monasteries with clerks translating and writing poems, however this process was very slow as it had to be done writing by hand and in many cases the poems were censored and transmitted with biased and poor information.  

## Editorial Rationale

---

Before making any comments on what I have done when editing the text I want to mention why this text is worth editing. This text, as you already know is a text of its own, the most famous example of this rhyming patterns and structure, but not only so, it is also one of the most famous elegies that we can find in Spanish history. For any Spanish history or literature  student or person with special interest in poems or elegies, this is an example worth knowing.  The poem has been translated before, which is unsurprising knowing the fame this poem possesses in Spain, being taught to adolescents around fourteen years-old.  
<br>
The first editorial decision I took was the selection of the texts to include. The selection was based on four different texts. The first one belongs to La Real Academia de la Lengua Española, the Spanish official institute designated to study how language develops and update the Spanish dictionary, modernizing language and grammar if necessary. Therefore, this text has academic support and it is based on the original one. The second one belongs to La Universidad de Valencia, Valencia’s University, having support of academic institutions and researchers that have adapted the text to contemporary Spanish vocabulary and grammar. The third one belongs to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, one of the most influential poets in 19th-Century America, famous for the translation of Dante’s Divine Comedy and Jorge Manrique’s Couplets to his Father’s Death. He belonged to the Fireside Poets, he lived in Spain’s capital city, Madrid, with Washington Irving, where he learned about Spanish literary culture and famous novelists and poets such as Cervantes, Lope de Vega or Pedro Calderón de la Barca. When his sister died, he found relief reading Jorge Manrique’s elegy, being that a possible reasoning for his translation of the poem. The fourth poem is my own translation of the poem, made to be more similar in meaning than in rhyme, for I think that a good piece of literature must have a good meaning even if it lacks form. However, the structure of the poem is still there, and I have tried to make it rhyme following the same pattern as the original one but using the language included in the updated version, because the language used in the original version has evolved and the words do not mean the same in modern Spanish.  
<br>
Personally I find Longfellow’s version to be more complex than it should be and it does not follow the rhyme pattern either, for that reason I think that using simpler and concise language would have a better impact on the reader, as this poem carries a strong sense of yearn or hanker.  
<br>
I carefully selected my word choice in the translation based on the meaning of the poem, while trying to honor original rhymes but giving preference to the meaning. The words may be too simple due to my lack of English vocabulary and the date in which the poem was written, for it contains a great sum of complex and outdated vocabulary that make sense when read but that makes the translation of the poem very difficult due to the fact that these words and expressions may not be used in Spanish anymore.  
<br>
I have created my own indentation following the original pattern but also changing it to create stops or differentiate stanzas as many of them could be read as stanzas that belong to the same meaning block, which is a block of text in the poem that constitutes a sentence on its own, in my opinion if the text was not indented the meaning of it would be lost or confusing.   
<br>
My focus on the translation was to keep the original meaning of the poem while not maintaining the form because I think the meaning is more important than the rhyme due to the fact that this poem is an elegy. The meaning is more central to the allusion to death’s honor and his father’s fame and importance. Consequently the rhyme pattern, although important and one of the most classic examples of Spanish Couplets, is not as essential as honoring the content.

[I]
### Real Academia de la Lengüa Española
        Recuerde el alma dormida,
abive el seso y despierte
        contemplando
cómo se pasa la vida,
cómo después de acordado
        da dolor,
cómo a nuestro parescer
cualquiera tiempo pasado
        fue mejor.
[II]
      Y pues vemos lo presente
cómo en un punto se es ido
        y acabado,
si juzgamos sabiamente,
daremos lo no venido
        por pasado.
No se engañe nadie, no,
pensando que a de durar
        lo que espera
más que duró lo que vio,
porque todo ha de pasar
        por tal manera.

### Universidad de Valencia
[I]
Recuerde el alma dormida,
avive el seso y despierte
contemplando
cómo se pasa la vida,
cómo se viene la muerte
tan callando;
cuán presto se va el placer;
cómo después de acordado
da dolor;
cómo a nuestro parecer
cualquiera tiempo pasado
fue mejor.
[II]
Pues si vemos lo presente
cómo en un punto se es ido
y acabado,
si juzgamos sabiamente,
daremos lo no venido
por pasado.
No se engañe nadie, no,
pensando que ha de durar
lo que espera
más que duró lo que vio,
pues que todo ha de pasar
por tal manera

### Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
 [I]
O let the soul her slumbers break,  
Let thought be quickened, and awake  
Awake to see How soon this life is past and gone,  
And death comes softly stealing on,  
How silently!  
<br>
Swiftly our pleasures glide away,  
Our hearts recall the distant day  
With many sighs;  
The moments that are speeding fast  
We heed not, but the past,—the past,  
More highly prize.  
<br>
Onward its course the present keeps,  
Onward the constant current sweeps,  
Till life is done;  
And, did we judge of time aright,  
The past and future in their flight  
Would be as one.  
<br>
Let no one fondly dream again,  
That Hope and all her shadowy train  
Will not decay;  
Fleeting as were the dreams of old,  
Remembered like a tale that’s told,  
They pass away.  

### Own version

[I]

Aware the sleeping soul,  
brighten the sense and wake up;  
&nbsp;contemplating  
how life passes,  
how death approaches  
&nbsp;so unspeaking;  
<br>
when, quickly leaves the enjoyment how,  
after remembered,  
&nbsp;it causes pain,  
how to our judgement  
any past time  
&nbsp;was better.  
<br>
[II]
Then, if we see the present  
as a point that is already gone  
<br>and done,  
if we judge wisely  
we will give what has not come  
<br>as done.  
<br>
Do not fool yourself, no,  
thinking that the things must last  
<br>what you think  
The things thy saw are gone,  
for everything must end  
<br>in that same way.
